# pkglist

A Bash script for Pacman users to generate a list of non-locally
installed packages

by Nick Bair

`pkglist` takes advantage of Pacman's built-in querying functions to
generate a list of installed packages. The script outputs a plain-text
file, one package name per line. This output is suitable for system
backups and can be used to restore packages on a newly-installed system
using the command:

	pacman -S $(< pkglist)

The output file is named {HOSTNAME}.pkglist. The file may be backed up
to a USB key, a cloud storage service such as Dropbox, or a pastebin
service such as GitHub Gist.
